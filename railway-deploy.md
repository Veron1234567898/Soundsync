# Railway Deployment Status

## Database Status: ✅ WORKING
Your PostgreSQL database is running perfectly:
- PostgreSQL 16.9 started successfully
- Listening on port 5432
- Ready to accept connections
- Health checks passing

## Web App Status: ❌ NEEDS DEPLOYMENT

### Quick Fix Steps:

1. **In Railway Dashboard:**
   - Click on `soundboard-app` service
   - Go to Variables tab
   - Add: `DATABASE_URL` = `${{ soundboard-db.DATABASE_URL }}`

2. **Deploy:**
   - Click Deploy button
   - Wait 3-5 minutes for build

3. **Get URL:**
   - Settings → Networking → Generate Domain

### If Still Failing:
Your build works locally, so it's likely a Railway configuration issue.

**Alternative deployment options:**
- Vercel (for static frontend)
- Heroku (simpler setup)
- DigitalOcean App Platform
- Back to Render (they fixed their issues)

The database is ready - just need to get the web app connected!
