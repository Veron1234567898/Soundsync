# Deployment Options - Railway Account Limited

## Problem
Your Railway account is on a limited plan that only allows database deployments, not web services.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Vercel (Recommended)
- **Cost**: Free tier available

- **Database**: Use your existing Railway PostgreSQL
- **Setup**: I've created `vercel.json` configuration

**Steps:**
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Add environment variable: `DATABASE_URL` (copy from Railway)
4. Deploy automatically

### Option 2: Netlify
- **Cost**: Free tier available
- **Good for**: Static sites + serverless functions
- **Database**: Use Railway PostgreSQL
- **Setup**: Simple GitHub integration

### Option 3: Heroku
- **Cost**: $5-7/month for hobby tier
- **Good for**: Full applications
- **Database**: Built-in PostgreSQL or use Railway
- **Setup**: Git-based deployment

### Option 4: DigitalOcean App Platform
- **Cost**: $5/month basic tier

### Option 5: Render (Back to Original)

## Current Assets Ready
✅ Database: Railway PostgreSQL running perfectly
✅ Code: Build works (343kb frontend, 22kb backend)
✅ Configuration: Multiple deployment configs ready

## Recommendation: Use Vercel
1. Keep your Railway database (it's working perfectly)
2. Deploy the web app to Vercel (free and reliable)
3. Connect them with the DATABASE_URL environment variable

This gives you the best of both worlds - Railway's excellent database service and Vercel's reliable web hosting.
