# Vercel + Railway Deployment Guide

## Issues Fixed:
✅ **Removed conflicting files**: Deleted `api/index.js` and `api/server.js` that were causing deployment conflicts
✅ **Updated API endpoint**: Fixed `api/index.ts` to use proper DatabaseStorage with Railway
✅ **Fixed schema references**: Updated property names to match database schema (`fileName` instead of `filename`)
✅ **Added environment checks**: Added validation for required DATABASE_URL

## Deployment Steps:

### 1. Railway Database Setup
1. Create a new project on Railway
2. Add PostgreSQL database service
3. Copy the DATABASE_URL from Railway dashboard
4. Make sure your database schema is deployed (run `npm run db:push` locally first)

### 2. Vercel Environment Variables
Add these environment variables in your Vercel dashboard:
- `DATABASE_URL` - Your Railway PostgreSQL connection string
- `NODE_ENV` - Set to `production`

### 3. Deploy to Vercel
The deployment should now work without the conflicting file error.

## Important Notes:
- File uploads in Vercel are handled in memory only (no persistent storage)
- For production file uploads, you'll need to integrate cloud storage (AWS S3, Cloudinary, etc.)
- WebSocket functionality won't work in Vercel - consider upgrading to Vercel Pro or using a separate service for real-time features
- Voice chat features won't work on serverless - these need a persistent connection

## Alternative Architecture:
Consider deploying the entire application to Railway instead of splitting between Vercel/Railway, as your app heavily relies on:
- WebSocket connections for real-time features
- File upload storage
- Voice chat functionality

These features work better on platforms that support persistent connections.
