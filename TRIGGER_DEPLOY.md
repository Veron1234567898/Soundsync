# Force Railway Deployment

## Current Status
✅ Repository connected: `goodwfs229-pixel/SOUNDBOARD2`
✅ Build works locally
✅ Database running
❌ Railway not deploying

## Quick Fix Options:

### Option 1: Force Deploy
In Railway dashboard:
1. Go to **soundboard-app** service
2. Click **Deploy** → **Force Deploy**
3. Monitor **Deployments** tab for build logs

### Option 2: Push Small Change
Make a small change to trigger auto-deploy:
1. Edit any file (like README)
2. Commit and push to GitHub
3. Railway will auto-deploy

### Option 3: Check Build Settings
In Railway service settings:
1. **Build Command**: Should be `npm run build`
2. **Start Command**: Should be `npm start`  
3. **Root Directory**: Should be `/` or empty

## Environment Variables Needed:
1. `DATABASE_URL` = `${{ soundboard-db.DATABASE_URL }}`
2. `NODE_ENV` = `production`

Your build outputs show it's working perfectly:
- Frontend: 343kb (index.js)
- Backend: 22kb (dist/index.js)
- Static files: Ready

Railway should pick this up automatically once we trigger the deployment!
