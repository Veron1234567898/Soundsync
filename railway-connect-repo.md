# Railway Repository Connection Guide

## Problem: No Active Deployment
Your soundboard-app service isn't connected to your GitHub repository yet.

## Solution: Connect Your Repository

### Step 1: Connect GitHub Repository
1. In Railway dashboard, click on **soundboard-app** service
2. Look for **"Connect Repository"** or **"Deploy from GitHub"** button
3. Authorize Railway to access your GitHub account
4. Select your soundboard project repository
5. Choose the **main** or **master** branch

### Step 2: Configure Service Settings
After connecting the repo:
1. **Root Directory**: Set to `/` (project root)
2. **Build Command**: `npm run build` (should auto-detect)
3. **Start Command**: `npm start` (should auto-detect)

### Step 3: Add Environment Variables
1. Go to **Variables** tab
2. Add: `DATABASE_URL` = `${{ soundboard-db.DATABASE_URL }}`
3. Add: `NODE_ENV` = `production`

### Step 4: Deploy
Railway will automatically start building once repository is connected.

## Alternative: Redeploy from Replit
If you're having trouble connecting GitHub:
1. Click the **Deploy** button in this Replit project
2. Choose **Railway**
3. This will create a new Railway project with proper GitHub integration

Your database is ready and waiting - just need to get the web app deployed!
